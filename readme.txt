== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does When Last Login do exactly? =
When Last Login allows you to see when last users have logged into your WordPress website. This is great for big sites that require user management. 

= Is When Last Login GDPR ready? =
Since version 1.0, we have made it easier to be GDPR compliant. With this being said, you need to take the necessary steps in order to become GDPR compliant - we are not a law firm!

= Is this plugin free? =
Yes, When Last Login is a free plugin for WordPress. We are looking into possibilities of creating a Pro version with a lot more features around the user data of WordPress users. We rely heavily on donations to keep all of our plugins free. If you wish to donate, please click on the donation link on the WordPress repository.

= Where is the When Last Login settings page? =
The settings page is found under the menu item 'When Last Login' within the WordPress dashboard.

= How can I remove data I no longer need? =
Inside your WordPress dashboard, navigate to 'When Last Login' -> 'Settings'. Under the 'Tools' heading, you will have a couple of actions that you can run, such as clear old login records, clear all login records and clear IP Addresses.

= I have installed When Last but users are showing "Never" under "Last Login"? =
This is because users have not logged in since you have activated "When Last Login". By default we set the "Last Login" to "Never" but this can be easily changed. Once a user logs into your site, their profile will be updated from "Never" to a timestamp.

= I have updated and lost my 'Login Records' link in the WordPress dashboard =
As of version 0.6 the 'Login Records' has been moved under the 'Users' link in the admin dashboard. 
Version 0.7 introduced a settings page menu item. The 'Login Records' can now be found under the 'When Last Login' menu item.

Inside your WordPress dashboard navigate to 'When Last Login' -> 'Settings' and deselect this option.

= How can I hide the 'Top 3 Users' widget? =
Add the following snippet of code to your theme's functions.php or custom plugin - add_filter( 'when_last_login_show_admin_widget', '__return_false' );
